1
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,989
You know what I like about people?

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,652
They stack so well.

3
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,614
Let me get this for you.

4
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,535
- Want the paper?
- No.

5
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:27,662
This is too much.

6
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:28,486
It's not half enough.

7
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:29,553
Thanks for opening up for me.

8
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:32,054
Any time, day or night.
You know that.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,212
In a town where everyone's

10
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:35,963
so carefully reinventing themselves,

11
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:37,298
what I like about Freddy

12
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:40,385
is that he doesn't even
pretend to change.

13
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:42,345
Ooh. I'm late.

14
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,555
Every Tuesday I sit down

15
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,557
with the speaker and the majority leader

16
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,141
to discuss the week's agenda.

17
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,477
Well, discuss is probably
the wrong word.

18
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:51,312
They talk while I sit quietly

19
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,272
and imaging their lightly salted faces

20
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:54,773
frying in a skillet.

21
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:12,450

22
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:36,000
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

23
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,252
Shitting herself,
or Walker is shitting himself

24
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:40,338
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

25
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:41,880
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

26
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,174
Do we have a backup on the docket?

27
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:44,592
You're on that, right, Frank?

28
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:45,843
Yeah, I'm working
with my staff--

29
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:47,178
Republicans are gonna ram this

30
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:49,013
up our ass.
I would if I was them.

31
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,515
Why, even if we squeak it
through the house,

32
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:52,350
watch them mangle it in the senate.

33
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,976
- Or filibuster.
- Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

34
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:55,436
I don't know why Walker's

35
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,396
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

36
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:58,648
It's madness.

37
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:00,316
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

38
00:03:00,317 --> 00:03:01,900
but I saw you
sitting over here--

39
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,736
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

40
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:05,613
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch and Congress--

41
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,657
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

42
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:09,950
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

43
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,077
Glendon Hill?
Great team over there.

44
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:13,663
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

45
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,414
When was the last time
they added a partner?

46
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,915
It's been a while.

47
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,584
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

48
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,461
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

49
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:22,129
Why did you let him go?

50
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,382
I didn't.
They stole him away.

51
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,800
What accounts do you have?

52
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,802
San Corp Industries is my main one.

53
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:29,554
I run that account now.

54
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,222
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

55
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,223
Sorry again to interrupt.

56
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,307
No problem.

57
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:35,434
Very nice to meet you both.

58
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,270
- Nice.
- Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

59
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,898
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

60
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,233
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

61
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:44,068
I'm gonna track down that check.

62
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:46,779
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,573
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

64
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,533
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

65
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,076
but I have 67 deputy whips,

66
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:54,245
and they all need cash to win races.

67
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,330
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

68
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,956
and in return they expect mine.

69
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,333
It's degrading, I know,

70
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,710
but when the tit's that big,

71
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:01,919
everybody gets in line.

72
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,299
Tell them I'm on top of it.

73
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,801
I need more than that.

74
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:11,303
You are well aware
that I do not drop the ball

75
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,638
on things like this, Remy.

76
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,015
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State,

77
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:16,392
Argentine and offshore
drilling contracts--

78
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:18,352
talk to me when I've solved the problem.

79
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,187
Don't waste my time when I'm
working on solving the problem.

80
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,313
When there's billions on the line,

81
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,565
I can't not show up.

82
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,982
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

83
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,860
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

84
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:28,696
6 million to build that library
of yours in your name.

85
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:30,948
- I know.
- Don't make them throw money

86
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,617
at your challenger next cycle.

87
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,118
You've made your point.

88
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,829
Have I? I hope so.

89
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,209
Such a waste of talent.

90
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,587
He chose money over power--

91
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,214
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

92
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:50,134
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

93
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,386
that starts falling apart
after ten years.

94
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:55,306
Power is the old stone building

95
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,934
that stands for centuries.

96
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:01,270
I cannot respect someone
who doesn't see the difference.

97
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:04,607
What am I looking at?

98
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,858
The Williams register.

99
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,234
- Williams?
- College.

100
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:08,444
September '78.

101
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:09,904
And why am I looking at it?

102
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:11,196
The editorial.

103
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:17,829
Not that interesting.

104
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,080
Michael Kern went to Williams.

105
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,749
Check out the masthead.

106
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,211
And then there's this.

107
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:29,632
It's thin.

108
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,843
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

109
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:33,719
- You think we can get traction with this?
- I think you could.

110
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,179
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

111
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,056
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

112
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,767
It's only 6 past 9:00.

113
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,686
Which means she read
the Herald 3 hours ago

114
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:44,355
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting
reamed by the president.

115
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,315
Tell her I'm on my way.

116
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,567
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you--

117
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,320
25 years he's been pushing
this particular agenda.

118
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:53,322
We got between the
mother bear and her cub.

119
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,907
It's a setback.
That's all.

120
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:56,492
On our first day in office.

121
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:58,285
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

122
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:00,287
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

123
00:06:00,288 --> 00:06:02,038
Frank, if you
can't control this--

124
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,958
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

125
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,752
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

126
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:08,838
Good luck.
I won't stand in your way.

127
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,174
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

128
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:15,177
If this thing can't make it to
the floor in the first 100 days,

129
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,762
then I'll let you explain
to the president

130
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:18,305
why he lied to the American people.

131
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:19,807
I'm gonna get back to work.

132
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,225
Please do.

133
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:42,580
Well, we really should be
doing this on a Friday

134
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:43,748
instead of a Wednesday.

135
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:45,583
If we do it on a Friday,

136
00:06:45,584 --> 00:06:47,919
- people have the weekend--
- Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,420
Is all the paperwork ready?

138
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,714
Some of the more senior
people are trickier.

139
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,382
There's severance.

140
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:54,967
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues.

141
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:58,804
No, no. We use at-will
employment contracts

142
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:00,096
across the board.

143
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,891
Well, get started first thing Friday.

144
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:04,977
I want all of the exit interviews

145
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:06,270
done by lunch.

146
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:08,439
Claire, I just can't help but think

147
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,024
that this is a mistake.

148
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:11,734
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

149
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,903
I know, I know,
but I just have to say it

150
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:15,863
for the sake of my conscience.

151
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,908
I think that you are dismantling

152
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,744
what we have built
over the past ten years,

153
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:22,954
and I--

154
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,463
and I think the way you're handling this

155
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:36,050
is...is cruel.

156
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,551
It's not easy, Evelyn.

157
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,554
But it's necessary.

158
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:44,100
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

159
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,810
It's how we work together.

160
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:48,186
I disagree with something, I say it.

161
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:51,523
Well, I disagree 100%.

162
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:54,151
Please, Claire, don't do this.

163
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:56,445
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

164
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:58,572
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

165
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:01,408
but I'm not going to change my mind.

166
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,329
Friday, then.

167
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,583
If that's what you want.

168
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,969
This is major reform,
a complete overhaul.

169
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,054
That would usually take months.

170
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,973
Well, we only have days, not months.

171
00:08:23,974 --> 00:08:25,557
But think about the process.
We can't just change--

172
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:28,853
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

173
00:08:28,854 --> 00:08:31,730
who are the smartest minds in education,

174
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:34,566
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you--

175
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,568
the six of you in this room.

176
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,362
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

177
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:41,365
but we have the opportunity
to make history here.

178
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,285
And I want all of us
to make it together.

179
00:08:45,286 --> 00:08:47,746
So good luck.
We're counting on you.

180
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:50,332
Page 1.

181
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,583
These bullet points

182
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:53,002
reflect the key planks

183
00:08:53,003 --> 00:08:54,712
at the center of our bill.

184
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:56,588
Get comfy.
This is your home

185
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,298
until we have a presentable first draft.

186
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,762
Donald, what a morning.

187
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:05,514
I have no idea how they got this.

188
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:06,974
I specifically told my staff

189
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,600
to destroy everything.
I can't imagine--

190
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,227
It doesn't matter how it happened.

191
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:12,396
We can't make it unhappen,
so we have to adapt.

192
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,481
Don't they realize
that this is a first draft?

193
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,316
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

194
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,903
We don't get a second chance
at a first impression, Donald.

195
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:21,572
You know that. Now,
look, I'm on your side,

196
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,782
but Linda is furious.

197
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:25,242
What's she saying?

198
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:27,203
They want to point fingers.

199
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:28,370
At me?

200
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,955
I told her we cannot do that.

201
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,832
I mean, you are vital to this process.

202
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,459
I'm up to here with them,
Donald--

203
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,546
for lying, for turning
their back on you.

204
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:40,049
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

205
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,093
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

206
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:44,344
just to piss them off.

207
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:46,055
Give me John king at CNN.

208
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,765
Wait, Frank.
This is not your fault.

209
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,808
No, we have to protect your reputation.

210
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:51,727
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the house.

211
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:54,521
I will-- hang on.
I will assign it to one of my deputies,

212
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,774
quietly manage it, and help
guide you through the process.

213
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:58,483
I am not comfortable with this.

214
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,153
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

215
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,407
What a martyr craves more than anything

216
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,909
is a sword to fall on,

217
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,702
so you sharpen the blade,

218
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,454
hold it at just the right angle,

219
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:13,249
and then 3, 2, 1--

220
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,374
It should be me.

221
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,626
It was my bill.

222
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:17,169
No. Impossible. Donald,

223
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,380
education has been your life's work.

224
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,011
The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

225
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,014
You know me. I'm not
a wheeler dealer.

226
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,682
I can put my mind to policy,

227
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:33,435
but I'm no good at this
brand of politics.

228
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:36,021
Well, if not you, then who?

229
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:43,654
It should be you, Frank.

230
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,031
You're formidable.
People respect you.

231
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:47,950
They will follow your lead.
Let me--

232
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,868
let me be on the sidelines for this.

233
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:56,708
Well, I could only
consider that as an option

234
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,963
if I knew that I could still
come to you for counsel.

235
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:04,216
Of course.
Whatever you need.

236
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:09,721
Part of me is glad this got leaked.

237
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,558
Well, it would have been
better if it hadn't,

238
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,937
but at least people know where I stand.

239
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,024
Thank you, Donald.

240
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,650
Happy to do it, Frank.

241
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,784
He has no idea we've got
six kids in the next room

242
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,203
already working on a new draft.

243
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,705
Stamper! But why dampen
his mood by telling him?

244
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,207
We just gave him
a great gift--

245
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,167
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

246
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:40,002
Write up a statement
for Blythe--

247
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,628
stepping aside, fresh ideas,

248
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:43,547
et cetera, et cetera,
and make it dignified.

249
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,798
He's a good man.

250
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,343
Oh. And bring me
that Williams editorial.

251
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:54,308
After careful thought
and discussion with my staff,

252
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,476
I am relinquishing my management

253
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:57,936
of the education reform act.

254
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:00,064
I hope to remain a part of the process,

255
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:01,106
but I won't be working--

256
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:02,524
Why did you leak the draft?

257
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:04,693
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

258
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:06,653
but, uh,
it does represent--

259
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,404
it came from your office,
though, correct?

260
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,907
Uh, we wrote it,
but I don't--

261
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:11,491
Who'll be managing the bill now?

262
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:12,492
Frank Underwood.

263
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:13,869
Was that your choice,

264
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,204
or did
the administration--

265
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:16,247
I feel very confident

266
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,373
placing the bill

267
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,790
in Frank's capable hands.

268
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,038
Ms. Barnes.

269
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,706
How very deep throat of you.

270
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:02,626
Well, I can't help you
dispatch a president.

271
00:13:02,627 --> 00:13:04,044
How about a senator?

272
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,879
The editorial on the Camp David accords.

273
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,173
"It is the opinion of this newspaper

274
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,301
"that President Carter demand Israel

275
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,802
"withdraw all its citizens

276
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:13,429
from the Gaza Strip
and West Bank."

277
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,390
"Which it has illegally
occupied since 1967."

278
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,350
Illegally occupied.

279
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,810
That's quite an incendiary
quote, don't you think?

280
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:21,561
For an administration that says

281
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,981
that the Middle East is its
top foreign policy priority.

282
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,274
Michael Kern?

283
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,567
Did he personally write the editorial?

284
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:29,485
He was the editor.

285
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,238
But did he write it himself?

286
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:34,992
Then there's no story.

287
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:38,494
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.

288
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:40,456
And if he denies involvement?

289
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:41,999
He will. Let him.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,209
This is a man trying to be confirmed

291
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,836
as Secretary of State.

292
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,545
Everything is a story.

293
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,964
There's no direct link.

294
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:52,508
I can't get this past Messerschmidt.

295
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,221
Remember this moment
when you resisted me,

296
00:13:56,222 --> 00:14:00,476
when you said the words
"Then there is no story."

297
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:04,396
Get a good night's
sleep, Ms. Barnes.

298
00:14:04,397 --> 00:14:06,398
You have a big day tomorrow.

299
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:30,506
Francis?

300
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,102
What is this?

301
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:45,187
What does it look like?

302
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:46,938
But the basement is mine.

303
00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:49,400
I know. It's not for me.

304
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,650
So who's it for?

305
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:51,860
For you.

306
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,611
There's a gym in the Capitol.

307
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,030
Which you never use.

308
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:57,074
Because I'm a tad busy
running the country.

309
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:59,284
But not at home, so now
you have no excuse.

310
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,452
I want it out.

311
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:01,828
Give it a try first.

312
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,038
Is this your subtle way

313
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,749
of saying that I'm out of shape?

314
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,084
No, it's my way of suggesting

315
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,668
you could be in better shape.

316
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:10,504
That sounds
both passive-aggressive

317
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:11,922
and condescending.

318
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:13,048
Just plain aggressive and true.

319
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,466
Don't wait up for me.

320
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,926
Are you going running now?

321
00:15:17,177 --> 00:15:18,595
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

322
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:19,971
I had an early meeting.

323
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:22,724
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

324
00:15:22,725 --> 00:15:24,518
You break it in.

325
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:30,065
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

326
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,110
And to turn my only sanctuary
into a fitness dungeon.

327
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:34,445
I won't have it.

328
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:36,905
It's a stretch.

329
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:38,656
We're not misleading anyone.

330
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,784
- He was the editor.
- Did you call for a comment?

331
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:42,911
I tried three times. The press
secretary said he'd get back to me.

332
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,913
- He didn't.
- What about research?

333
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,582
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

334
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,125
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

335
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,876
Don't you think if something
like that existed,

336
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,587
someone would have printed it by now?

337
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:53,004
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

338
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,756
I don't think there's a story here.

339
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:56,633
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying

340
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,760
is that there's a question
that needs to be answered.

341
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,473
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

342
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,724
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

343
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,143
Which he didn't write.

344
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,145
Which we don't know he didn't write.

345
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,605
Exactly.

346
00:16:09,606 --> 00:16:10,814
We don't have to print it.

347
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:12,149
I could just scan the thing,

348
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,858
stick it on a site, and tweet the link.

349
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,402
But if I did that,
some other paper might--

350
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:17,779
Whoa, whoa.
Don't be a bitch.

351
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,657
I'll talk to Tom.

352
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:22,534
That's all I was asking.

353
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,411
We simply can't afford
to allow the--

354
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,954
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

355
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,998
He's a libertarian drug fiend

356
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,541
- marinating in a mobile home.
- Shh.

357
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,293
I didn't agree with President Reagan

358
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:32,503
on many things,

359
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:33,962
but there was some merit

360
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,589
to the notion
of trickle-down economics,

361
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,132
and I feel there is much merit

362
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,552
to the idea
of trickle-down diplomacy.

363
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:42,137
Those are my lines.

364
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,721
Vasquez must have given them to him.

365
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:45,599
...stalemate between
Israel and Palestine,

366
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,393
that success will trickle down

367
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:49,894
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas

368
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:51,771
between Muslims,
Jews, Christians--

369
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,607
I'm glad you brought up
Israel and Palestine

370
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,359
because just before we came on the air,

371
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,027
I received an advance copy of an article

372
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,695
that's going to be in tomorrow's

373
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,238
Washington Herald's front page

374
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,990
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

375
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,950
and in it she quotes an editorial

376
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,952
that ran in the Williams
college register

377
00:17:05,953 --> 00:17:08,997
when you were editor
back in September 1978,

378
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,374
which called the Israeli presence

379
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,833
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,

380
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,628
quote, an illegal occupation.

381
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:16,463
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

382
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,632
Did you write those words,
"illegal occupation"?

383
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,592
No. I have
no memory of this.

384
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:22,427
But you were the editor of the paper.

385
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,887
Yes, but--

386
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,263
So it couldn't have gone out

387
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:26,557
without your approval.

388
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:28,808
No, of course not,
but my staff--

389
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,519
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

390
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,604
the, uh-- and then
we'd vote, and if--

391
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,022
Did you vote for it?

392
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:35,190
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

393
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,358
It was 35 years ago.

394
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,859
So you're not sure

395
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,528
whether or not you
supported these words--

396
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,488
I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt

397
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,365
I did not write these words.

398
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,034
But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?

399
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:48,620
This is ludicrous.

400
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,081
That's all we need--
him laughing.

401
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,832
I know it was
a long time ago--

402
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,501
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

403
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:57,045
The Middle East is a vital
American interest.

404
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:59,089
What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.

405
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,299
You can look at my voting record.

406
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,885
Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel--

407
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,887
So when did your views change?

408
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,222
What I'm saying to you
is my--

409
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:08,390
What's important now, George,

410
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,141
is how I have voted

411
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,310
while I have represented
the great state of Colorado--

412
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:14,354
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people

413
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:15,939
are going to look at it
and think what you thought then

414
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,232
is relevant as well.

415
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,816
Have you ever changed your views

416
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,902
- since college?
- I'm not the nominee

417
00:18:20,903 --> 00:18:22,237
for Secretary of State.

418
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,573
Uh,
even if I did have--

419
00:18:24,574 --> 00:18:25,865
It's golden.

420
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,158
This has not been my views--

421
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,577
It's a bull's eye.

422
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:30,621
What were you saying when you came in?

423
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:33,373
So, ahem, I found a guy

424
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:35,083
who was on the college editorial staff

425
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:36,293
when Kern was there.

426
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,628
This burnout,

427
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:39,421
still pumping mimeographed manifestos

428
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:41,089
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

429
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,758
You're not planning on talking to him.

430
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,342
Peter Russo.

431
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:46,303
Good.

432
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,096
Sounds like a perfect match.

433
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,226
Dennis.

434
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,853
Any chance you're watching
Stephanopoulos?

435
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:07,115
You look sexy when you're improving

436
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,618
the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

437
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:10,952
Is it the improving lives,

438
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:12,496
or is it these fetching sweat pants?

439
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,623
Move that computer out of the way.

440
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:16,374
Let me see what that looks like.

441
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:21,045
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

442
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,714
Fuck off.

443
00:19:22,715 --> 00:19:24,257
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

444
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:27,469
I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

445
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,722
Hey, you know, I don't think

446
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:32,516
I've ever seen you
brush your teeth before.

447
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,184
- Sure you have.
- No, I don't think so.

448
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,353
I know that you do brush,
but I don't think

449
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:37,813
I've ever actually witnessed it before.

450
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,815
Well, here it is in all its glory.

451
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:41,608
Is that my toothbrush?

452
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,734
I don't know. Is it?

453
00:19:42,735 --> 00:19:43,943
Yes, it is.

454
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:45,779
- You left it here.
- Peter, gross.

455
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,071
Oh, come on.

456
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:49,115
We've exchanged plenty of fluids.

457
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,160
Ohh. Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

458
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:53,453
No. Toothpaste.

459
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,955
It's not toothpaste.
I'm ravished.

460
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,248
No.

461
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:58,500
Mm.

462
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:03,129
Go get it.

463
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,965
- I have to take this.
- Ohh.

464
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:08,301
This is Russo.

465
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:18,144
Yeah.
Right now it's 12:53.

466
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:26,319
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:31,658
I have to go.

468
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:33,243
Is everything okay?

469
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:34,703
It's work stuff.

470
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,287
What kind of work stuff?

471
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:38,331
Congressman Wallinski.
He wants to go over

472
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:41,042
the tax incentive stuff we sent him.

473
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,502
Peter,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

474
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,463
Hey, Peter.

475
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,890
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing.

476
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,350
Congress will survive without you.

477
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:00,186
Address, directions.

478
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,856
There's an e-ticket
in your name.

479
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:08,737
Your flight leaves
at 6:30.

480
00:21:08,738 --> 00:21:11,281
- You should head to the airport.
- This is coming from Frank?

481
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,491
No. This is coming
from no one.

482
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,619
You have the flu,
and you're calling in sick.

483
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:19,163
- What's that?
- What's what?

484
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:21,833
Is that a hickey?

485
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,627
Are you whoring around again?

486
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:26,045
- No. I have a girlfriend.
- Mm.

487
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,882
You mean your little office romance.

488
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:30,759
What do you know about that?

489
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,553
When it comes to your life,
Peter, and what I know about it,

490
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:37,223
you should assume that there's
no such thing as a secret.

491
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:39,100
Stay in touch.

492
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,937
You call me on my cell,
never at the office.

493
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,148
Good luck.

494
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:49,319
Knock 'em dead, tiger.

495
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:08,505
How are we?

496
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:11,842
Overtired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.

497
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:14,761
- Less than a week to go.
- Yeah. We'll do our best.

498
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,138
- You'll what?
- We'll get it done.

499
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,850
Somebody open a window.
It's rancid in here.

500
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:21,935
That is what happens when six people

501
00:22:21,936 --> 00:22:24,354
don't shower for half a week.

502
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:26,105
Anything you need other than deodorant?

503
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,858
Yeah, this performance standards thing.

504
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,276
- The teachers unions are gonna--
- Leave it in.

505
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,737
- But we could delete it.
- I'll handle the unions. What else? Anything?

506
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:34,865
Conjugal visits?

507
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:36,366
I'll get back to work.

508
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:40,286
Nancy.

509
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:42,455
- Coming.
- What do I have next?

510
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,958
Constituent calls
from 2:10 to 2:35,

511
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,794
- fundraising until 3:50, deputy caucus at 4:00.
- The call list?

512
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:49,838
- It's on your desk.
- My briefing for the caucus?

513
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,965
- Next to the call list.
- Have you been in the conference room?

514
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:53,967
Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.

515
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:56,093
In the meantime, get those poor
kids some Febreze or something.

516
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:57,136
It's like a petting zoo.

517
00:22:58,514 --> 00:23:01,599
You gotta see this.

518
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,602
But were they in line
with your thinking at the time?

519
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:07,939
We do not consider the issue of Israel

520
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,065
and Palestine a laughing matter.

521
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,027
And he calls Israel illegal.

522
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:14,654
Well, he's an anti-semite,
and he is wrong.

523
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,032
We would have grave, grave concerns

524
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:20,035
about appointing such a man
our next Secretary of State.

525
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:24,706
It's too easy.

526
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:32,107
Roy, hi.

527
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:34,692
My name is Peter Russo.
Congressman Russo.

528
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:38,071
I'd like to just
speak to you for just a...

529
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:39,530
Sir?

530
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:42,366
Either you're lying,
and you can fuck off;

531
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,954
or you're telling the truth,
and you can absolutely fuck off.

532
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:48,539
I saw your web site.

533
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,667
I'm a fan.

534
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,712
And I brought you something.

535
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:08,476
Hey, babe, put some clothes on.

536
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:10,478
- What?
- We got a guest.

537
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,105
So? Hey.

538
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:13,898
Put some clothes on.

539
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:18,235
Ice or no ice?

540
00:25:18,236 --> 00:25:20,113
- Uh, no ice.
- Good.

541
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:22,657
We don't have any.

542
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,957
Fuck. Echo, I told you
to put the--

543
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,710
It's okay. It's okay.

544
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:36,629
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

545
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:39,465
A congressman, you say?

546
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:41,885
Right now,
I'm just a drinking companion.

547
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,511
Well, all right, companion.

548
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,220
Have yourself a drink.

549
00:25:58,193 --> 00:26:00,195
Come on in.

550
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,796
$10,000.

551
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:21,465
What will that get me?

552
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:25,136
I mean, I'm kinky, but I don't know
if I'm the girl you're looking for.

553
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:29,057
You're definitely the girl
that I'm looking for.

554
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,519
Excuse me.

555
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,980
All I want for that money
is your silence.

556
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:37,857
My what?

557
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,650
The guy you were with the other night,

558
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,195
the one who was arrested,
do you know who he was?

559
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,655
You mean the congressman?

560
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:47,033
There was no congressman.
There was no arrest.

561
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:48,743
None of that exists.

562
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:50,578
All that exists

563
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,872
is the money sitting right there
in front of you.

564
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:55,125
Do you understand?

565
00:26:56,793 --> 00:26:58,293
Yeah.

566
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:00,922
Good.

567
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,470
Open your mouth.

568
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:26,864
Last little bit's for me.

569
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,046
You're scolding me.

570
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,423
Am I?

571
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:47,342
You are, silently.

572
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,431
- Is it the rowing machine?
- You tell me.

573
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,142
It's the rowing machine.

574
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:57,103
- You haven't used it.
- How do you know I haven't?

575
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:58,395
Francis.

576
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,481
You know I don't like to be managed.

577
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:02,608
I'm not trying to manage you.

578
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,862
I just don't want
to outlive you by 25 years.

579
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:08,198
I must walk three miles a day
around that Capitol.

580
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:09,866
I'm constantly on my feet.

581
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,869
And do you know how many
calories the brain burns?

582
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,912
I'm not worried about your brain.

583
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:18,373
It's your heart we're talking about.

584
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:23,087
Use the machine.

585
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,218
She's right.

586
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:30,303
I should take better care of myself.

587
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:31,888
But it's the principle.

588
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:34,307
I won't be a slave
to anybody or anything

589
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:37,518
you can order
with a toll-free number.

590
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:51,407
We share the wealth in this republic.

591
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,834
I thought the whole
editorial team pitched in.

592
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:04,545
Sometimes.
Not that time, though.

593
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:06,547
But he must have written some of it?

594
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:10,551
No. That was all me.

595
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,638
What if people thought he wrote it?

596
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:16,766
Oh, fuck that.
He's a fraud.

597
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:20,228
Nah, he's worse than a fraud.
He's a fucking farce.

598
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:21,812
I'll tell you something.

599
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,815
He used to be even more
of a maniac than I am.

600
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:27,484
- Chemicals?
- No. Politics.

601
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:29,987
Oh, we had some nights, man.
Long conversations,

602
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:32,198
dangerous fucking notions.

603
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,491
- Like what?
- You name it-- OPEC,

604
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:37,078
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

605
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,164
Then the motherland
sang her mating call.

606
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,666
♪ O say can you-- ♪

607
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:45,128
Next thing, he's cramming
for the bar at Bryn Mawr

608
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:46,629
and snapping on a flag pin.

609
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,672
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

610
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:52,009
My point is, he started goose-stepping
in the marionette parade.

611
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,553
Left, right; red, blue;
Democrat, Republican.

612
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:57,140
We're all dangling
from the same strings.

613
00:29:57,141 --> 00:30:00,643
Take a sledgehammer to the whole
fucking Punch and Judy show.

614
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:03,520
- That's what's required.
- Thought you were a patriot.

615
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,481
Fuck, yeah.
One of the few.

616
00:30:05,482 --> 00:30:08,276
- So what's wrong with public service?
- Public service?

617
00:30:08,277 --> 00:30:11,446
Come on. You gotta get a grip
on who your masters are.

618
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:15,908
The I.M.F., the World Bank,
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

619
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,828
You bankroll their fucking death squads.

620
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:22,373
It's called FEMA;
it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms;

621
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:24,292
NATO; Border Control.

622
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:26,127
You think Katrina was incompetence?

623
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,212
That was highly orchestrated negligence.

624
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:31,841
Look at Waco, Amnesty
International, the A.C.L.U.

625
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:35,261
Smokescreens-- all of them.
Blood on their hands.

626
00:30:35,262 --> 00:30:37,054
Well, exactly.

627
00:30:38,597 --> 00:30:40,599
You want me to lie to the people.

628
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,519
I want you to spare the people
another hypocrite.

629
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,147
What's in it for you?

630
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:48,691
Poetic justice.

631
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,194
Oh, come on.
You're one of them.

632
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:55,406
Can a corporate sellout
roll a joint like this?

633
00:30:55,407 --> 00:31:02,079
♪ Lord knows, I can't change ♪

634
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,999
If I wanted to do this thing,

635
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,710
how might I go about that, precisely?

636
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:19,847
How did it go?

637
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:22,517
There were a few tears here and there

638
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:24,810
and some anger,

639
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,480
but nothing unexpected.

640
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:34,237
I'm going to need you to
leave us today, too, Evelyn.

641
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,155
I'm sorry.

642
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:38,866
I just can't have any doubt
about the direction I'm taking.

643
00:31:44,747 --> 00:31:47,458
You just had me fire 18 people.

644
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,377
I know.

645
00:31:49,378 --> 00:31:51,462
I sat across from them in this room,

646
00:31:51,463 --> 00:31:54,006
and I had to tell
each and every one of--

647
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,674
I know.

648
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:59,011
I am 59 years old.

649
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,055
Nobody hires anybody my age.

650
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:03,266
I will write you
any kind of recommenda--

651
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,642
To do what, bag groceries?

652
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,811
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?

653
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:10,106
I'm sorry, Evelyn.
I truly am.

654
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:12,149
No, you're not.
You don't give a fuck.

655
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:16,820
Eighteen people, Claire.

656
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:23,244
Nineteen, if you count me.

657
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:27,373
I have to...

658
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,043
I have to call my daughter.

659
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,712
I know today has been tough.

660
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:18,174
A lot of your colleagues have left,

661
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:20,926
and I owe you an explanation.

662
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,721
Many of those who left us today

663
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:26,890
helped build the C.W.I.
from the ground up,

664
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:29,101
and I'm grateful to them.

665
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:32,229
But it is time for us to evolve,

666
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,730
and to accomplish this,

667
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:37,109
we had to make hard choices

668
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,529
and bring in new people.

669
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,114
That's what today was about.

670
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:45,576
You have any questions,

671
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:48,329
my door is always open.

672
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,458
I'm all good for national and metro.

673
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:55,169
We've got space for political
if we need it.

674
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,713
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

675
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,256
The White House is dodging.

676
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:02,009
You can't get anyone on record?

677
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,553
Not just me.

678
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,596
They're shutting all of us down
in the briefings.

679
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:08,432
No one is giving an inch,
even on background.

680
00:34:08,433 --> 00:34:10,226
In the meantime,
I'm working on a feature

681
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:12,144
about the administration's
foreign policy agenda.

682
00:34:12,145 --> 00:34:14,188
How it shifted
from the start of the campaign,

683
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:16,148
- increased D.O.D. spending, and--
- Received, Zoe.

684
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:19,735
I can link Kern directly
to the Williams editorial.

685
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,071
- What?
- I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak

686
00:34:22,072 --> 00:34:24,365
who was on the editorial staff
when Kern was there.

687
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,158
Hey, Twitter twat,
W.T.F.?

688
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,369
- Wait, wait, wait. Roy what?
- Kapeniak.

689
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,953
A classmate of Kern's.

690
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:32,415
I have him on record saying
Kern wrote every word

691
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,833
- of the editorial.
- Let's move this into my office.

692
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,210
Zoe, Lucas.

693
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:44,301
Janine.

694
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,557
Let me-- let me,
once and for all,

695
00:34:49,558 --> 00:34:50,933
say this definitively:

696
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:53,269
I didn't author that editorial.

697
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,522
Not a single sentence,
word, comma, or period.

698
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:59,442
If memory serves me, it was
Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

699
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:02,903
Why on earth he's trying to
claim that I did is beyond me.

700
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:06,532
Let me further say that I'm a strong
supporter of the state of Israel.

701
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:08,701
As the most stable country in the region

702
00:35:08,702 --> 00:35:12,622
- and our strongest ally...
- It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.

703
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,206
...in any peace process,

704
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:16,709
because without the stability of Israel,

705
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,544
there can be no Palestine.

706
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:21,297
CNN right now.

707
00:35:23,966 --> 00:35:26,218
"Without Israel
there can be no Palestine"?

708
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,845
- I've got it on.
- I would remind Senator Kern

709
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:32,057
that there was a Palestine long
before there was an Israel.

710
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:35,311
His comments are not only
ignorant, they are racist.

711
00:35:35,312 --> 00:35:38,689
Get ready, Cathy. Things are
about to move very quickly.

712
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,733
- ...his understanding of the Middle East--
- Okay.

713
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:42,859
- ...is so out of sync with reality...
- I'm ready.

714
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,112
Hey.

715
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:47,239
- Peter? No. Stop.
- Uh, not now.

716
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,700
Hey. Hey,
where have you been?

717
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:53,496
Oh, God, you're fucking high.

718
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,539
- No. I--
- Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.

719
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,041
Oh, please, just lay off.

720
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:02,004
You promised me
it wouldn't be like this.

721
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:05,424
Cancel whatever I have
for the rest of the day.

722
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:44,296
Kern is out.

723
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,256
They're tossing him?

724
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:49,176
Technically, that would
draw himself, but yes.

725
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:51,345
Can I say "A source
close to the White House"?

726
00:36:51,346 --> 00:36:53,889
No. You let this story
play out on its own time.

727
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,599
They'll announce in the morning.

728
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,644
I'm sorry. If not that,
what story are we talking about?

729
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:00,563
Catherine Durant.

730
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:04,233
As soon as Kern withdraws, you
say she'll be the replacement.

731
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:07,277
- Is that true?
- It will be after you write it.

732
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:10,531
Roy Kapeniak was you.

733
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:14,243
You might very well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

734
00:37:14,244 --> 00:37:16,161
You found him.
You had him call me.

735
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:18,831
Kapeniak and Kern were
appetizers, Miss Barnes.

736
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:21,625
Catherine Durant is the meal.

737
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:26,589
Say that name:
Catherine Durant.

738
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,674
Say it over and over.

739
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:31,301
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,

740
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:34,096
and then watch that name
come out of the mouth

741
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:37,516
of the President of the United States.

742
00:37:37,517 --> 00:37:40,477
This is where we get to create.

743
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:49,069
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

744
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,447
It's the last one tonight.

745
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:56,034
Zoe Barnes with the Washington
Herald now reporting,

746
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:57,536
quoting a source close to the president,

747
00:37:57,537 --> 00:37:59,413
as saying that Senator Catherine Durant

748
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:02,040
will likely be the new nominee
for Secretary of State

749
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,919
after Michael Kern's withdrawal
earlier this week.

750
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,212
The White House has remained
silent on whether the president

751
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,839
will tap Durant for a nomination,

752
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,507
but a national Zogby Poll

753
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:13,093
shows wide support for Durant
across party lines.

754
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,805
Catherine Durant has served ten years on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

755
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,557
made numerous diplomatic
missions to South America...

756
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:21,477
We can place our faith in her,
knowing that we have a responsible,

757
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:24,521
experienced, brilliant woman
representing our interests abroad.

758
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:27,983
Middle of the road, team
player, strong in defense.

759
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:30,569
If there's a woman that can work with
the joint chiefs, she's the one.

760
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,822
Durant is the way to go.
It's a no-brainer.

761
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:35,407
The president should stop this
pageant and simply make the call.

762
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:38,160
Why are we still talking about, if
they're going to nominate Durant?

763
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:39,787
Why don't they just do it already

764
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:41,956
so we can all stop talking about ifs

765
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:43,833
and start talking about when and what

766
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:47,711
and how Durant's going to
shape up foreign policy...

767
00:39:13,863 --> 00:39:16,114
So, history?

768
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,535
History.

769
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:26,333
I'm very impressed, Frank.

770
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,084
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mock-up.

771
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:29,879
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

772
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,964
Not yet. I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

773
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,008
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the president.

774
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:37,093
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

775
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:40,347
- Thank you, Frank.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

776
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:43,726
- I so apologize for everything--
- No, no, no, n--

777
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,228
it's not necessary.

778
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,313
Now for the real meeting.

779
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:51,692
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

780
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:53,777
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

781
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:56,112
You know who you're gonna tap next?

782
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:58,448
Frank, we still need you
in the house--

783
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:00,534
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

784
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:03,037
We've got our education bill.
I was just curious.

785
00:40:03,038 --> 00:40:04,955
Somehow the rumor is flying around

786
00:40:04,956 --> 00:40:06,790
that we're gonna nominate
Catherine Durant.

787
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:09,543
- I'm sure you've noticed.
- Is the rumor true?

788
00:40:09,544 --> 00:40:11,253
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

789
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,963
but the president asked me
to have her vetted

790
00:40:12,964 --> 00:40:15,382
in case we wanna go that route.

791
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:18,176
- Interesting.
- What do you think?

792
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:23,390
Well, she wouldn't be
my first choice--

793
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:25,017
Who would be your first choice?

794
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:27,310
She campaigned hard against us
in the primaries.

795
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:30,981
- That's my reservation.
- But you'd show yourself above party politics,

796
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:33,191
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

797
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,819
Decent experience,
respect across the aisle.

798
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,947
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

799
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,534
It's not the worst idea in the world.

800
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:05,181
- Where are you getting this shit?
- What?

801
00:41:05,182 --> 00:41:08,644
- Your stories. Who are you fucking?
- I was just--

802
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,563
- Nobody.
- Oh, come on.

803
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:14,817
You're a metro scrub,
and now look at you.

804
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:16,735
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

805
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:19,696
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

806
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:21,615
Excuse me.

807
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:29,623
All set.

808
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,128
- Is this your first remote?
- Yeah, it's my first time.

809
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:47,016
Right into the camera,
don't shift in your seat,

810
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:49,643
and there's no reason to speak
above a conversational volume.

811
00:41:49,644 --> 00:41:51,895
- The mic will pick you up. You all ready?
- Yeah.

812
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:54,148
All right.
Don't forget to breathe.

813
00:41:57,734 --> 00:42:00,278
Five, four...

814
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:08,370
We'd like to welcome Zoe
Barnes from the Washington Herald.

815
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:10,497
Zoe, thank you for joining us.

816
00:42:10,498 --> 00:42:13,208
I'm very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

817
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:16,712
You broke the education bill, the
Kern editorial, and now Durant.

818
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:19,339
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

819
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,257
And it's truly been a team effort.

820
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:23,259
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.

821
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,347
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

822
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:29,641
First national story, first...

823
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,569
Thank you.

824
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:44,322
Calling it a night.

825
00:42:45,448 --> 00:42:48,077
See you tomorrow, sir.

826
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,543
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

827
00:42:56,544 --> 00:42:59,171
First national story,

828
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,339
first front-page byline,

829
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,967
first TV interview.

830
00:43:03,968 --> 00:43:08,805
I would wave to my mom, but the
cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

831
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:14,811
What a roller coaster.

832
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:18,732
It really is too bad.
Kern was a good man.

833
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:21,026
- And now Catherine Durant.
- Yes.

834
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,403
Right place, right time, I suppose.

835
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:26,322
- We like her, don't we?
- Very much.

836
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:29,492
Question is, does she like San
Corp as much as we like her?

837
00:43:29,493 --> 00:43:32,079
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

838
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,039
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

839
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,708
- No. You always like a sure thing.
- When it avails itself.

840
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:38,752
- Good night, Remy.
- Good night, Frank.

841
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:42,214
- See you around.
- Hopefully less and less now.

842
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,763
Oh, no.
I charged the wrong thing.

843
00:43:49,764 --> 00:43:52,599
- What did you have again?
- A medium decaf latte.

844
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,145
Med lat, dec.

845
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:02,901
I don't know how to get it to go back.

846
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:05,528
- This one and this one.
- This one?

847
00:44:05,529 --> 00:44:07,697
No. Let me do it.

848
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:22,963
I have to ask you
to stay back, congressman.

849
00:44:22,964 --> 00:44:25,590
- What's going on?
- Some guy was trying to get into the building.

850
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:28,802
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

851
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:54,619
Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

852
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,705
Nothing will come of this.

853
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:03,586
Why don't you let these nice
gentlemen take you home?

854
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:13,763
Cover him up.
It's cold out here.

855
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:15,974
You heard the congressman.

856
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:18,060
Cover him up.

857
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,084
Francis?

858
00:46:31,218 --> 00:46:41,829
