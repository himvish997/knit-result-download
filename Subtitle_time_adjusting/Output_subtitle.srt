1
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:25,489
You know what I like about people?

2
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,152
They stack so well.

3
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:31,114
Let me get this for you.

4
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,035
- Want the paper?
- No.

5
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,162
This is too much.

6
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:39,986
It's not half enough.

7
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:41,053
Thanks for opening up for me.

8
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:43,554
Any time, day or night.
You know that.

9
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,712
In a town where everyone's

10
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,463
so carefully reinventing themselves,

11
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:48,798
what I like about Freddy

12
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,885
is that he doesn't even
pretend to change.

13
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:53,845
Ooh. I'm late.

14
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,055
Every Tuesday I sit down

15
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,057
with the speaker and the majority leader

16
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,641
to discuss the week's agenda.

17
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:60,977
Well, discuss is probably
the wrong word.

18
00:02:60,978 --> 00:02:62,812
They talk while I sit quietly

19
00:02:62,813 --> 00:02:64,772
and imaging their lightly salted faces

20
00:02:64,773 --> 00:02:66,273
frying in a skillet.

21
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:23,950
Sync & corections by Addic7ed.com
www.addic7ed.com

22
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,500
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

23
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,752
Shitting herself,
or Walker is shitting himself

24
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,838
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

25
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,380
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

26
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,674
Do we have a backup on the docket?

27
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,092
You're on that, right, Frank?

28
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,343
Yeah, I'm working
with my staff--

29
00:03:57,344 --> 00:03:58,678
Republicans are gonna ram this

30
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:60,513
up our ass.
I would if I was them.

31
00:04:60,514 --> 00:04:62,015
Why, even if we squeak it
through the house,

32
00:04:62,016 --> 00:04:63,850
watch them mangle it in the senate.

33
00:04:63,851 --> 00:04:65,476
- Or filibuster.
- Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

34
00:04:65,477 --> 00:04:66,936
I don't know why Walker's

35
00:04:66,937 --> 00:04:68,896
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

36
00:04:68,897 --> 00:04:70,148
It's madness.

37
00:04:70,149 --> 00:04:11,816
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

38
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,400
but I saw you
sitting over here--

39
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,236
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

40
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:17,113
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch and Congress--

41
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:19,157
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

42
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,450
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

43
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:23,577
Glendon Hill?
Great team over there.

44
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,163
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

45
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,914
When was the last time
they added a partner?

46
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:28,415
It's been a while.

47
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,084
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

48
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:31,961
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

49
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:33,629
Why did you let him go?

50
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,882
I didn't.
They stole him away.

51
00:04:35,883 --> 00:04:37,300
What accounts do you have?

52
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:39,302
San Corp Industries is my main one.

53
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:41,054
I run that account now.

54
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,722
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

55
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:43,723
Sorry again to interrupt.

56
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:44,807
No problem.

57
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,934
Very nice to meet you both.

58
00:04:46,935 --> 00:04:49,770
- Nice.
- Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

59
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,398
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

60
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,733
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

61
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,568
I'm gonna track down that check.

62
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,279
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:60,073
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

64
00:05:60,074 --> 00:05:62,033
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

65
00:05:62,034 --> 00:05:63,576
but I have 67 deputy whips,

66
00:05:63,577 --> 00:05:65,745
and they all need cash to win races.

67
00:05:65,746 --> 00:05:67,830
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

68
00:05:67,831 --> 00:05:69,456
and in return they expect mine.

69
00:05:69,457 --> 00:05:70,833
It's degrading, I know,

70
00:05:70,834 --> 00:05:12,210
but when the tit's that big,

71
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,419
everybody gets in line.

72
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:18,799
Tell them I'm on top of it.

73
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,301
I need more than that.

74
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:22,803
You are well aware
that I do not drop the ball

75
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,138
on things like this, Remy.

76
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,515
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State,

77
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,892
Argentine and offshore
drilling contracts--

78
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,852
talk to me when I've solved the problem.

79
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,687
Don't waste my time when I'm
working on solving the problem.

80
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,813
When there's billions on the line,

81
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:34,065
I can't not show up.

82
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:35,482
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

83
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,360
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

84
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,196
6 million to build that library
of yours in your name.

85
00:05:40,197 --> 00:05:42,448
- I know.
- Don't make them throw money

86
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,117
at your challenger next cycle.

87
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,618
You've made your point.

88
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:48,329
Have I? I hope so.

89
00:05:51,582 --> 00:05:53,709
Such a waste of talent.

90
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,087
He chose money over power--

91
00:05:56,088 --> 00:05:58,714
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

92
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:61,634
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

93
00:06:61,635 --> 00:06:63,886
that starts falling apart
after ten years.

94
00:06:63,887 --> 00:06:66,806
Power is the old stone building

95
00:06:66,807 --> 00:06:69,434
that stands for centuries.

96
00:06:69,435 --> 00:06:12,770
I cannot respect someone
who doesn't see the difference.

97
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,107
What am I looking at?

98
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:17,358
The Williams register.

99
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,734
- Williams?
- College.

100
00:06:18,735 --> 00:06:19,944
September '78.

101
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:21,404
And why am I looking at it?

102
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,696
The editorial.

103
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,329
Not that interesting.

104
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,580
Michael Kern went to Williams.

105
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,249
Check out the masthead.

106
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:37,711
And then there's this.

107
00:06:39,672 --> 00:06:41,132
It's thin.

108
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,343
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

109
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,219
- You think we can get traction with this?
- I think you could.

110
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,679
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,556
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

112
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:51,267
It's only 6 past 9:00.

113
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,186
Which means she read
the Herald 3 hours ago

114
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,855
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting
reamed by the president.

115
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,815
Tell her I'm on my way.

116
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:60,067
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you--

117
00:07:60,068 --> 00:07:62,820
25 years he's been pushing
this particular agenda.

118
00:07:62,821 --> 00:07:64,822
We got between the
mother bear and her cub.

119
00:07:64,823 --> 00:07:66,407
It's a setback.
That's all.

120
00:07:66,408 --> 00:07:67,992
On our first day in office.

121
00:07:67,993 --> 00:07:69,785
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

122
00:07:69,786 --> 00:07:11,787
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

123
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:13,538
Frank, if you
can't control this--

124
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,458
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

125
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,252
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

126
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:20,338
Good luck.
I won't stand in your way.

127
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,674
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

128
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:26,677
If this thing can't make it to
the floor in the first 100 days,

129
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,262
then I'll let you explain
to the president

130
00:07:28,263 --> 00:07:29,805
why he lied to the American people.

131
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,307
I'm gonna get back to work.

132
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,725
Please do.

133
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:54,080
Well, we really should be
doing this on a Friday

134
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:55,248
instead of a Wednesday.

135
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,083
If we do it on a Friday,

136
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,419
- people have the weekend--
- Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

137
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:60,920
Is all the paperwork ready?

138
00:08:60,921 --> 00:08:63,214
Some of the more senior
people are trickier.

139
00:08:63,215 --> 00:08:64,882
There's severance.

140
00:08:64,883 --> 00:08:66,467
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues.

141
00:08:66,468 --> 00:08:70,304
No, no. We use at-will
employment contracts

142
00:08:70,305 --> 00:08:11,596
across the board.

143
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,391
Well, get started first thing Friday.

144
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,477
I want all of the exit interviews

145
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:17,770
done by lunch.

146
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:19,939
Claire, I just can't help but think

147
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,524
that this is a mistake.

148
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,234
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

149
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,403
I know, I know,
but I just have to say it

150
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,363
for the sake of my conscience.

151
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:30,408
I think that you are dismantling

152
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,244
what we have built
over the past ten years,

153
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,454
and I--

154
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,963
and I think the way you're handling this

155
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:47,550
is...is cruel.

156
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,051
It's not easy, Evelyn.

157
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,054
But it's necessary.

158
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:55,600
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

159
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,310
It's how we work together.

160
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:59,686
I disagree with something, I say it.

161
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:63,023
Well, I disagree 100%.

162
00:09:63,024 --> 00:09:65,651
Please, Claire, don't do this.

163
00:09:65,652 --> 00:09:67,945
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

164
00:09:67,946 --> 00:09:70,072
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

165
00:09:70,073 --> 00:09:12,908
but I'm not going to change my mind.

166
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:16,829
Friday, then.

167
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,083
If that's what you want.

168
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,469
This is major reform,
a complete overhaul.

169
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,554
That would usually take months.

170
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,473
Well, we only have days, not months.

171
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,057
But think about the process.
We can't just change--

172
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:40,353
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

173
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:43,230
who are the smartest minds in education,

174
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,066
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you--

175
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,068
the six of you in this room.

176
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:49,862
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

177
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,865
but we have the opportunity
to make history here.

178
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,785
And I want all of us
to make it together.

179
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,246
So good luck.
We're counting on you.

180
00:10:60,747 --> 00:10:61,832
Page 1.

181
00:10:61,833 --> 00:10:63,083
These bullet points

182
00:10:63,084 --> 00:10:64,502
reflect the key planks

183
00:10:64,503 --> 00:10:66,212
at the center of our bill.

184
00:10:66,213 --> 00:10:68,088
Get comfy.
This is your home

185
00:10:68,089 --> 00:10:69,798
until we have a presentable first draft.

186
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,262
Donald, what a morning.

187
00:10:15,263 --> 00:10:17,014
I have no idea how they got this.

188
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,474
I specifically told my staff

189
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,100
to destroy everything.
I can't imagine--

190
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,727
It doesn't matter how it happened.

191
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,896
We can't make it unhappen,
so we have to adapt.

192
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,981
Don't they realize
that this is a first draft?

193
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:27,816
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

194
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,403
We don't get a second chance
at a first impression, Donald.

195
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,072
You know that. Now,
look, I'm on your side,

196
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,282
but Linda is furious.

197
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,742
What's she saying?

198
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:38,703
They want to point fingers.

199
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,870
At me?

200
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,455
I told her we cannot do that.

201
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:43,332
I mean, you are vital to this process.

202
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,959
I'm up to here with them,
Donald--

203
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,046
for lying, for turning
their back on you.

204
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:51,549
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

205
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,593
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

206
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,844
just to piss them off.

207
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,555
Give me John king at CNN.

208
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,265
Wait, Frank.
This is not your fault.

209
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:61,308
No, we have to protect your reputation.

210
00:11:61,309 --> 00:11:63,227
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the house.

211
00:11:63,228 --> 00:11:66,021
I will-- hang on.
I will assign it to one of my deputies,

212
00:11:66,022 --> 00:11:68,274
quietly manage it, and help
guide you through the process.

213
00:11:68,275 --> 00:11:69,983
I am not comfortable with this.

214
00:11:69,984 --> 00:11:12,653
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

215
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:16,907
What a martyr craves more than anything

216
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,409
is a sword to fall on,

217
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,202
so you sharpen the blade,

218
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:21,954
hold it at just the right angle,

219
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,749
and then 3, 2, 1--

220
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,874
It should be me.

221
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,126
It was my bill.

222
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:28,669
No. Impossible. Donald,

223
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,880
education has been your life's work.

224
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,511
The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

225
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:40,514
You know me. I'm not
a wheeler dealer.

226
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,182
I can put my mind to policy,

227
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:44,935
but I'm no good at this
brand of politics.

228
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:47,521
Well, if not you, then who?

229
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:55,154
It should be you, Frank.

230
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:57,531
You're formidable.
People respect you.

231
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:59,450
They will follow your lead.
Let me--

232
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:61,368
let me be on the sidelines for this.

233
00:12:65,748 --> 00:12:68,208
Well, I could only
consider that as an option

234
00:12:68,209 --> 00:12:12,463
if I knew that I could still
come to you for counsel.

235
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:15,716
Of course.
Whatever you need.

236
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:21,221
Part of me is glad this got leaked.

237
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:25,058
Well, it would have been
better if it hadn't,

238
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,437
but at least people know where I stand.

239
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,524
Thank you, Donald.

240
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,150
Happy to do it, Frank.

241
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,284
He has no idea we've got
six kids in the next room

242
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,703
already working on a new draft.

243
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:46,205
Stamper! But why dampen
his mood by telling him?

244
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,707
We just gave him
a great gift--

245
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,667
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

246
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,502
Write up a statement
for Blythe--

247
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,128
stepping aside, fresh ideas,

248
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,047
et cetera, et cetera,
and make it dignified.

249
00:12:55,048 --> 00:12:56,298
He's a good man.

250
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,843
Oh. And bring me
that Williams editorial.

251
00:13:62,805 --> 00:13:65,808
After careful thought
and discussion with my staff,

252
00:13:65,809 --> 00:13:67,976
I am relinquishing my management

253
00:13:67,977 --> 00:13:69,436
of the education reform act.

254
00:13:69,437 --> 00:13:11,564
I hope to remain a part of the process,

255
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:12,606
but I won't be working--

256
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,024
Why did you leak the draft?

257
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,193
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

258
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,153
but, uh,
it does represent--

259
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:19,904
it came from your office,
though, correct?

260
00:13:19,905 --> 00:13:21,407
Uh, we wrote it,
but I don't--

261
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,991
Who'll be managing the bill now?

262
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:23,992
Frank Underwood.

263
00:13:23,993 --> 00:13:25,369
Was that your choice,

264
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,704
or did
the administration--

265
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,747
I feel very confident

266
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:28,873
placing the bill

267
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,290
in Frank's capable hands.

268
00:14:68,328 --> 00:14:69,538
Ms. Barnes.

269
00:14:69,539 --> 00:14:71,206
How very deep throat of you.

270
00:14:71,207 --> 00:14:14,126
Well, I can't help you
dispatch a president.

271
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:15,544
How about a senator?

272
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,379
The editorial on the Camp David accords.

273
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,673
"It is the opinion of this newspaper

274
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:21,801
"that President Carter demand Israel

275
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:23,302
"withdraw all its citizens

276
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,929
from the Gaza Strip
and West Bank."

277
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,890
"Which it has illegally
occupied since 1967."

278
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:29,850
Illegally occupied.

279
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,310
That's quite an incendiary
quote, don't you think?

280
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:33,061
For an administration that says

281
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:35,481
that the Middle East is its
top foreign policy priority.

282
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:36,774
Michael Kern?

283
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,067
Did he personally write the editorial?

284
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,985
He was the editor.

285
00:14:40,986 --> 00:14:42,738
But did he write it himself?

286
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,492
Then there's no story.

287
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:49,994
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.

288
00:14:49,995 --> 00:14:51,956
And if he denies involvement?

289
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,499
He will. Let him.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,709
This is a man trying to be confirmed

291
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,336
as Secretary of State.

292
00:14:57,337 --> 00:14:59,045
Everything is a story.

293
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:60,464
There's no direct link.

294
00:15:60,465 --> 00:15:64,008
I can't get this past Messerschmidt.

295
00:15:64,009 --> 00:15:67,721
Remember this moment
when you resisted me,

296
00:15:67,722 --> 00:15:11,976
when you said the words
"Then there is no story."

297
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,896
Get a good night's
sleep, Ms. Barnes.

298
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,898
You have a big day tomorrow.

299
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:42,006
Francis?

300
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,602
What is this?

301
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:56,687
What does it look like?

302
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,438
But the basement is mine.

303
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:60,900
I know. It's not for me.

304
00:16:60,901 --> 00:16:62,150
So who's it for?

305
00:16:62,151 --> 00:16:63,360
For you.

306
00:16:63,361 --> 00:16:65,111
There's a gym in the Capitol.

307
00:16:65,112 --> 00:16:66,530
Which you never use.

308
00:16:66,531 --> 00:16:68,574
Because I'm a tad busy
running the country.

309
00:16:68,575 --> 00:16:70,784
But not at home, so now
you have no excuse.

310
00:16:70,785 --> 00:16:11,952
I want it out.

311
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,328
Give it a try first.

312
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,538
Is this your subtle way

313
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,249
of saying that I'm out of shape?

314
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,584
No, it's my way of suggesting

315
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,168
you could be in better shape.

316
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,004
That sounds
both passive-aggressive

317
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,422
and condescending.

318
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:24,548
Just plain aggressive and true.

319
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:25,966
Don't wait up for me.

320
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,426
Are you going running now?

321
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:30,095
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

322
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:31,471
I had an early meeting.

323
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:34,224
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

324
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,018
You break it in.

325
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,565
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

326
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:44,610
And to turn my only sanctuary
into a fitness dungeon.

327
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,945
I won't have it.

328
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,405
It's a stretch.

329
00:16:48,406 --> 00:16:50,156
We're not misleading anyone.

330
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:52,284
- He was the editor.
- Did you call for a comment?

331
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,411
I tried three times. The press
secretary said he'd get back to me.

332
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,413
- He didn't.
- What about research?

333
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:58,082
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

334
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,625
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

335
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:61,376
Don't you think if something
like that existed,

336
00:17:61,377 --> 00:17:63,087
someone would have printed it by now?

337
00:17:63,088 --> 00:17:64,504
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

338
00:17:64,505 --> 00:17:66,256
I don't think there's a story here.

339
00:17:66,257 --> 00:17:68,133
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying

340
00:17:68,134 --> 00:17:70,260
is that there's a question
that needs to be answered.

341
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:13,973
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

342
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,224
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

343
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,643
Which he didn't write.

344
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,645
Which we don't know he didn't write.

345
00:17:19,646 --> 00:17:21,105
Exactly.

346
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,314
We don't have to print it.

347
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,649
I could just scan the thing,

348
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,358
stick it on a site, and tweet the link.

349
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,902
But if I did that,
some other paper might--

350
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,279
Whoa, whoa.
Don't be a bitch.

351
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,157
I'll talk to Tom.

352
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:34,034
That's all I was asking.

353
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,911
We simply can't afford
to allow the--

354
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:37,454
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

355
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,498
He's a libertarian drug fiend

356
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,041
- marinating in a mobile home.
- Shh.

357
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,793
I didn't agree with President Reagan

358
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,003
on many things,

359
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:45,462
but there was some merit

360
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,089
to the notion
of trickle-down economics,

361
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,632
and I feel there is much merit

362
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:52,052
to the idea
of trickle-down diplomacy.

363
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:53,637
Those are my lines.

364
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,221
Vasquez must have given them to him.

365
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,099
...stalemate between
Israel and Palestine,

366
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,893
that success will trickle down

367
00:17:59,894 --> 00:18:61,394
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas

368
00:18:61,395 --> 00:18:63,271
between Muslims,
Jews, Christians--

369
00:18:63,272 --> 00:18:65,107
I'm glad you brought up
Israel and Palestine

370
00:18:65,108 --> 00:18:66,859
because just before we came on the air,

371
00:18:66,860 --> 00:18:68,527
I received an advance copy of an article

372
00:18:68,528 --> 00:18:70,195
that's going to be in tomorrow's

373
00:18:70,196 --> 00:18:11,738
Washington Herald's front page

374
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:13,490
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

375
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,450
and in it she quotes an editorial

376
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,452
that ran in the Williams
college register

377
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:20,497
when you were editor
back in September 1978,

378
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:21,874
which called the Israeli presence

379
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,333
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,

380
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,128
quote, an illegal occupation.

381
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,963
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

382
00:18:27,964 --> 00:18:30,132
Did you write those words,
"illegal occupation"?

383
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,092
No. I have
no memory of this.

384
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,927
But you were the editor of the paper.

385
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:35,387
Yes, but--

386
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:36,763
So it couldn't have gone out

387
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:38,057
without your approval.

388
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:40,308
No, of course not,
but my staff--

389
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,019
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

390
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,104
the, uh-- and then
we'd vote, and if--

391
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:45,522
Did you vote for it?

392
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:46,690
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

393
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:47,858
It was 35 years ago.

394
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:49,359
So you're not sure

395
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,028
whether or not you
supported these words--

396
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,988
I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt

397
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,865
I did not write these words.

398
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,534
But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?

399
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:60,120
This is ludicrous.

400
00:19:60,121 --> 00:19:62,581
That's all we need--
him laughing.

401
00:19:62,582 --> 00:19:64,332
I know it was
a long time ago--

402
00:19:64,333 --> 00:19:66,001
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

403
00:19:66,002 --> 00:19:68,545
The Middle East is a vital
American interest.

404
00:19:68,546 --> 00:19:70,589
What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.

405
00:19:70,590 --> 00:19:12,799
You can look at my voting record.

406
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,385
Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel--

407
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,387
So when did your views change?

408
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:18,722
What I'm saying to you
is my--

409
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:19,890
What's important now, George,

410
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,641
is how I have voted

411
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,810
while I have represented
the great state of Colorado--

412
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:25,854
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people

413
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:27,439
are going to look at it
and think what you thought then

414
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,732
is relevant as well.

415
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,316
Have you ever changed your views

416
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,402
- since college?
- I'm not the nominee

417
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:33,737
for Secretary of State.

418
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,073
Uh,
even if I did have--

419
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,365
It's golden.

420
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:38,658
This has not been my views--

421
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,077
It's a bull's eye.

422
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,121
What were you saying when you came in?

423
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:44,873
So, ahem, I found a guy

424
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,583
who was on the college editorial staff

425
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:47,793
when Kern was there.

426
00:19:47,794 --> 00:19:49,128
This burnout,

427
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,921
still pumping mimeographed manifestos

428
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,589
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

429
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,258
You're not planning on talking to him.

430
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,842
Peter Russo.

431
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:57,803
Good.

432
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,596
Sounds like a perfect match.

433
00:20:62,682 --> 00:20:64,726
Dennis.

434
00:20:64,727 --> 00:20:67,353
Any chance you're watching
Stephanopoulos?

435
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:18,615
You look sexy when you're improving

436
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:21,118
the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

437
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,452
Is it the improving lives,

438
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:23,996
or is it these fetching sweat pants?

439
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:26,123
Move that computer out of the way.

440
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,874
Let me see what that looks like.

441
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,545
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

442
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:34,214
Fuck off.

443
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,757
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

444
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:38,969
I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

445
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,222
Hey, you know, I don't think

446
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,016
I've ever seen you
brush your teeth before.

447
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,684
- Sure you have.
- No, I don't think so.

448
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,853
I know that you do brush,
but I don't think

449
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:49,313
I've ever actually witnessed it before.

450
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,315
Well, here it is in all its glory.

451
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,108
Is that my toothbrush?

452
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:54,234
I don't know. Is it?

453
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,443
Yes, it is.

454
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:57,279
- You left it here.
- Peter, gross.

455
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,571
Oh, come on.

456
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:60,615
We've exchanged plenty of fluids.

457
00:21:60,616 --> 00:21:63,660
Ohh. Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

458
00:21:63,661 --> 00:21:64,953
No. Toothpaste.

459
00:21:64,954 --> 00:21:67,455
It's not toothpaste.
I'm ravished.

460
00:21:67,456 --> 00:21:68,748
No.

461
00:21:68,749 --> 00:21:70,000
Mm.

462
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:14,629
Go get it.

463
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,465
- I have to take this.
- Ohh.

464
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,801
This is Russo.

465
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:29,644
Yeah.
Right now it's 12:53.

466
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,819
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,158
I have to go.

468
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,743
Is everything okay?

469
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:46,203
It's work stuff.

470
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,787
What kind of work stuff?

471
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,831
Congressman Wallinski.
He wants to go over

472
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:52,542
the tax incentive stuff we sent him.

473
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:54,002
Peter,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

474
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:56,963
Hey, Peter.

475
00:22:63,220 --> 00:22:66,390
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing.

476
00:22:66,391 --> 00:22:68,850
Congress will survive without you.

477
00:22:68,851 --> 00:22:11,686
Address, directions.

478
00:22:11,687 --> 00:22:14,356
There's an e-ticket
in your name.

479
00:22:18,318 --> 00:22:20,237
Your flight leaves
at 6:30.

480
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,781
- You should head to the airport.
- This is coming from Frank?

481
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:24,991
No. This is coming
from no one.

482
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,119
You have the flu,
and you're calling in sick.

483
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,663
- What's that?
- What's what?

484
00:22:30,664 --> 00:22:33,333
Is that a hickey?

485
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:35,127
Are you whoring around again?

486
00:22:35,128 --> 00:22:37,545
- No. I have a girlfriend.
- Mm.

487
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,382
You mean your little office romance.

488
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,259
What do you know about that?

489
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,053
When it comes to your life,
Peter, and what I know about it,

490
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:48,723
you should assume that there's
no such thing as a secret.

491
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:50,600
Stay in touch.

492
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,437
You call me on my cell,
never at the office.

493
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:56,648
Good luck.

494
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:60,819
Knock 'em dead, tiger.

495
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:20,005
How are we?

496
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:23,342
Overtired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.

497
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:26,261
- Less than a week to go.
- Yeah. We'll do our best.

498
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,638
- You'll what?
- We'll get it done.

499
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:31,350
Somebody open a window.
It's rancid in here.

500
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:33,435
That is what happens when six people

501
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,854
don't shower for half a week.

502
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:37,605
Anything you need other than deodorant?

503
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:39,358
Yeah, this performance standards thing.

504
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,776
- The teachers unions are gonna--
- Leave it in.

505
00:23:41,777 --> 00:23:44,237
- But we could delete it.
- I'll handle the unions. What else? Anything?

506
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:46,365
Conjugal visits?

507
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:47,866
I'll get back to work.

508
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:51,786
Nancy.

509
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:53,955
- Coming.
- What do I have next?

510
00:23:53,956 --> 00:23:56,458
Constituent calls
from 2:10 to 2:35,

511
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:59,294
- fundraising until 3:50, deputy caucus at 4:00.
- The call list?

512
00:23:59,295 --> 00:24:61,338
- It's on your desk.
- My briefing for the caucus?

513
00:24:61,339 --> 00:24:63,465
- Next to the call list.
- Have you been in the conference room?

514
00:24:63,466 --> 00:24:65,467
Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.

515
00:24:65,468 --> 00:24:67,593
In the meantime, get those poor
kids some Febreze or something.

516
00:24:67,594 --> 00:24:68,636
It's like a petting zoo.

517
00:24:70,014 --> 00:24:13,099
You gotta see this.

518
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,102
But were they in line
with your thinking at the time?

519
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:19,439
We do not consider the issue of Israel

520
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,565
and Palestine a laughing matter.

521
00:24:21,566 --> 00:24:23,527
And he calls Israel illegal.

522
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,154
Well, he's an anti-semite,
and he is wrong.

523
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:28,532
We would have grave, grave concerns

524
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:31,535
about appointing such a man
our next Secretary of State.

525
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:36,206
It's too easy.

526
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,607
Roy, hi.

527
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,192
My name is Peter Russo.
Congressman Russo.

528
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:49,571
I'd like to just
speak to you for just a...

529
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:51,030
Sir?

530
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:53,866
Either you're lying,
and you can fuck off;

531
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:57,454
or you're telling the truth,
and you can absolutely fuck off.

532
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:60,039
I saw your web site.

533
00:26:60,040 --> 00:26:62,167
I'm a fan.

534
00:26:64,127 --> 00:26:66,212
And I brought you something.

535
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,976
Hey, babe, put some clothes on.

536
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:21,978
- What?
- We got a guest.

537
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,605
So? Hey.

538
00:26:23,606 --> 00:26:25,398
Put some clothes on.

539
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,735
Ice or no ice?

540
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:31,613
- Uh, no ice.
- Good.

541
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:34,157
We don't have any.

542
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,457
Fuck. Echo, I told you
to put the--

543
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,210
It's okay. It's okay.

544
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:48,129
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

545
00:26:49,088 --> 00:26:50,965
A congressman, you say?

546
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:53,385
Right now,
I'm just a drinking companion.

547
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,011
Well, all right, companion.

548
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:56,720
Have yourself a drink.

549
00:27:69,693 --> 00:27:11,695
Come on in.

550
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,296
$10,000.

551
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:32,965
What will that get me?

552
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:36,636
I mean, I'm kinky, but I don't know
if I'm the girl you're looking for.

553
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:40,557
You're definitely the girl
that I'm looking for.

554
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,019
Excuse me.

555
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,480
All I want for that money
is your silence.

556
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,357
My what?

557
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:51,150
The guy you were with the other night,

558
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:53,695
the one who was arrested,
do you know who he was?

559
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:56,155
You mean the congressman?

560
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:58,533
There was no congressman.
There was no arrest.

561
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:60,243
None of that exists.

562
00:28:60,244 --> 00:28:62,078
All that exists

563
00:28:62,079 --> 00:28:64,372
is the money sitting right there
in front of you.

564
00:28:64,373 --> 00:28:66,625
Do you understand?

565
00:28:68,293 --> 00:28:69,793
Yeah.

566
00:28:70,712 --> 00:28:12,422
Good.

567
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,970
Open your mouth.

568
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:38,364
Last little bit's for me.

569
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,546
You're scolding me.

570
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:55,923
Am I?

571
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:58,842
You are, silently.

572
00:29:61,220 --> 00:29:63,931
- Is it the rowing machine?
- You tell me.

573
00:29:63,932 --> 00:29:65,642
It's the rowing machine.

574
00:29:65,643 --> 00:29:68,603
- You haven't used it.
- How do you know I haven't?

575
00:29:68,604 --> 00:29:69,895
Francis.

576
00:29:69,896 --> 00:29:11,981
You know I don't like to be managed.

577
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,108
I'm not trying to manage you.

578
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:17,362
I just don't want
to outlive you by 25 years.

579
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:19,698
I must walk three miles a day
around that Capitol.

580
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,366
I'm constantly on my feet.

581
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,369
And do you know how many
calories the brain burns?

582
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,412
I'm not worried about your brain.

583
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:29,873
It's your heart we're talking about.

584
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:34,587
Use the machine.

585
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:39,718
She's right.

586
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,803
I should take better care of myself.

587
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,388
But it's the principle.

588
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:45,807
I won't be a slave
to anybody or anything

589
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:49,018
you can order
with a toll-free number.

590
00:30:60,321 --> 00:30:62,907
We share the wealth in this republic.

591
00:30:70,499 --> 00:30:13,334
I thought the whole
editorial team pitched in.

592
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:16,045
Sometimes.
Not that time, though.

593
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:18,047
But he must have written some of it?

594
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:22,051
No. That was all me.

595
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,138
What if people thought he wrote it?

596
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:28,266
Oh, fuck that.
He's a fraud.

597
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:31,728
Nah, he's worse than a fraud.
He's a fucking farce.

598
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,312
I'll tell you something.

599
00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:36,315
He used to be even more
of a maniac than I am.

600
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:38,984
- Chemicals?
- No. Politics.

601
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:41,487
Oh, we had some nights, man.
Long conversations,

602
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:43,698
dangerous fucking notions.

603
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:45,991
- Like what?
- You name it-- OPEC,

604
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:48,578
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

605
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:51,664
Then the motherland
sang her mating call.

606
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:54,166
♪ O say can you-- ♪

607
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:56,628
Next thing, he's cramming
for the bar at Bryn Mawr

608
00:30:56,629 --> 00:30:58,129
and snapping on a flag pin.

609
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:60,172
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

610
00:31:60,173 --> 00:31:63,509
My point is, he started goose-stepping
in the marionette parade.

611
00:31:63,510 --> 00:31:66,053
Left, right; red, blue;
Democrat, Republican.

612
00:31:66,054 --> 00:31:68,640
We're all dangling
from the same strings.

613
00:31:68,641 --> 00:31:12,143
Take a sledgehammer to the whole
fucking Punch and Judy show.

614
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:15,020
- That's what's required.
- Thought you were a patriot.

615
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:16,981
Fuck, yeah.
One of the few.

616
00:31:16,982 --> 00:31:19,776
- So what's wrong with public service?
- Public service?

617
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,946
Come on. You gotta get a grip
on who your masters are.

618
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:27,408
The I.M.F., the World Bank,
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

619
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:30,328
You bankroll their fucking death squads.

620
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:33,873
It's called FEMA;
it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms;

621
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,792
NATO; Border Control.

622
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,627
You think Katrina was incompetence?

623
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:39,712
That was highly orchestrated negligence.

624
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:43,341
Look at Waco, Amnesty
International, the A.C.L.U.

625
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:46,761
Smokescreens-- all of them.
Blood on their hands.

626
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:48,554
Well, exactly.

627
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:52,099
You want me to lie to the people.

628
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,019
I want you to spare the people
another hypocrite.

629
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,647
What's in it for you?

630
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:60,191
Poetic justice.

631
00:32:60,192 --> 00:32:62,694
Oh, come on.
You're one of them.

632
00:32:64,195 --> 00:32:66,906
Can a corporate sellout
roll a joint like this?

633
00:32:66,907 --> 00:32:13,579
♪ Lord knows, I can't change ♪

634
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,499
If I wanted to do this thing,

635
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,210
how might I go about that, precisely?

636
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:31,347
How did it go?

637
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,017
There were a few tears here and there

638
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,310
and some anger,

639
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,980
but nothing unexpected.

640
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:45,737
I'm going to need you to
leave us today, too, Evelyn.

641
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:47,655
I'm sorry.

642
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:50,366
I just can't have any doubt
about the direction I'm taking.

643
00:32:56,247 --> 00:32:58,958
You just had me fire 18 people.

644
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:60,877
I know.

645
00:33:60,878 --> 00:33:62,962
I sat across from them in this room,

646
00:33:62,963 --> 00:33:65,506
and I had to tell
each and every one of--

647
00:33:65,507 --> 00:33:67,174
I know.

648
00:33:68,551 --> 00:33:70,511
I am 59 years old.

649
00:33:70,512 --> 00:33:12,555
Nobody hires anybody my age.

650
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,766
I will write you
any kind of recommenda--

651
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,142
To do what, bag groceries?

652
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:19,311
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?

653
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:21,606
I'm sorry, Evelyn.
I truly am.

654
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,649
No, you're not.
You don't give a fuck.

655
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,320
Eighteen people, Claire.

656
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:34,744
Nineteen, if you count me.

657
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:38,873
I have to...

658
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,543
I have to call my daughter.

659
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:27,212
I know today has been tough.

660
00:34:27,213 --> 00:34:29,674
A lot of your colleagues have left,

661
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:32,426
and I owe you an explanation.

662
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:36,221
Many of those who left us today

663
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:38,390
helped build the C.W.I.
from the ground up,

664
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,601
and I'm grateful to them.

665
00:34:40,602 --> 00:34:43,729
But it is time for us to evolve,

666
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,230
and to accomplish this,

667
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:48,609
we had to make hard choices

668
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:51,029
and bring in new people.

669
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,614
That's what today was about.

670
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:57,076
You have any questions,

671
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,829
my door is always open.

672
00:35:61,330 --> 00:35:63,958
I'm all good for national and metro.

673
00:35:63,959 --> 00:35:66,669
We've got space for political
if we need it.

674
00:35:66,670 --> 00:35:69,213
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

675
00:35:69,214 --> 00:35:70,756
The White House is dodging.

676
00:35:70,757 --> 00:35:13,509
You can't get anyone on record?

677
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,053
Not just me.

678
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:17,096
They're shutting all of us down
in the briefings.

679
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:19,932
No one is giving an inch,
even on background.

680
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,726
In the meantime,
I'm working on a feature

681
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,644
about the administration's
foreign policy agenda.

682
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:25,688
How it shifted
from the start of the campaign,

683
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:27,648
- increased D.O.D. spending, and--
- Received, Zoe.

684
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:31,235
I can link Kern directly
to the Williams editorial.

685
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:33,571
- What?
- I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak

686
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:35,865
who was on the editorial staff
when Kern was there.

687
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,658
Hey, Twitter twat,
W.T.F.?

688
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:39,869
- Wait, wait, wait. Roy what?
- Kapeniak.

689
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,453
A classmate of Kern's.

690
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:43,915
I have him on record saying
Kern wrote every word

691
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,333
- of the editorial.
- Let's move this into my office.

692
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,710
Zoe, Lucas.

693
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,801
Janine.

694
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:61,057
Let me-- let me,
once and for all,

695
00:36:61,058 --> 00:36:62,433
say this definitively:

696
00:36:62,434 --> 00:36:64,769
I didn't author that editorial.

697
00:36:64,770 --> 00:36:68,022
Not a single sentence,
word, comma, or period.

698
00:36:68,023 --> 00:36:70,942
If memory serves me, it was
Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

699
00:36:70,943 --> 00:36:14,403
Why on earth he's trying to
claim that I did is beyond me.

700
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:18,032
Let me further say that I'm a strong
supporter of the state of Israel.

701
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:20,201
As the most stable country in the region

702
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:24,122
- and our strongest ally...
- It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.

703
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,706
...in any peace process,

704
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:28,209
because without the stability of Israel,

705
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,044
there can be no Palestine.

706
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:32,797
CNN right now.

707
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:37,718
"Without Israel
there can be no Palestine"?

708
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:40,345
- I've got it on.
- I would remind Senator Kern

709
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:43,557
that there was a Palestine long
before there was an Israel.

710
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:46,811
His comments are not only
ignorant, they are racist.

711
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:50,189
Get ready, Cathy. Things are
about to move very quickly.

712
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,233
- ...his understanding of the Middle East--
- Okay.

713
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:54,359
- ...is so out of sync with reality...
- I'm ready.

714
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,612
Hey.

715
00:36:56,613 --> 00:36:58,739
- Peter? No. Stop.
- Uh, not now.

716
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:61,200
Hey. Hey,
where have you been?

717
00:37:62,285 --> 00:37:64,996
Oh, God, you're fucking high.

718
00:37:64,997 --> 00:37:67,039
- No. I--
- Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.

719
00:37:67,040 --> 00:37:69,541
Oh, please, just lay off.

720
00:37:69,542 --> 00:37:13,504
You promised me
it wouldn't be like this.

721
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:16,924
Cancel whatever I have
for the rest of the day.

722
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,796
Kern is out.

723
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,756
They're tossing him?

724
00:37:57,757 --> 00:38:60,676
Technically, that would
draw himself, but yes.

725
00:38:60,677 --> 00:38:62,845
Can I say "A source
close to the White House"?

726
00:38:62,846 --> 00:38:65,389
No. You let this story
play out on its own time.

727
00:38:65,390 --> 00:38:67,099
They'll announce in the morning.

728
00:38:67,100 --> 00:38:70,144
I'm sorry. If not that,
what story are we talking about?

729
00:38:70,145 --> 00:38:12,063
Catherine Durant.

730
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:15,733
As soon as Kern withdraws, you
say she'll be the replacement.

731
00:38:15,734 --> 00:38:18,777
- Is that true?
- It will be after you write it.

732
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,031
Roy Kapeniak was you.

733
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:25,743
You might very well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

734
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:27,661
You found him.
You had him call me.

735
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:30,331
Kapeniak and Kern were
appetizers, Miss Barnes.

736
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:33,125
Catherine Durant is the meal.

737
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:38,089
Say that name:
Catherine Durant.

738
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,174
Say it over and over.

739
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:42,801
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,

740
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:45,596
and then watch that name
come out of the mouth

741
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:49,016
of the President of the United States.

742
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:51,977
This is where we get to create.

743
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:60,569
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

744
00:39:60,570 --> 00:39:62,947
It's the last one tonight.

745
00:39:64,823 --> 00:39:67,534
Zoe Barnes with the Washington
Herald now reporting,

746
00:39:67,535 --> 00:39:69,036
quoting a source close to the president,

747
00:39:69,037 --> 00:39:70,913
as saying that Senator Catherine Durant

748
00:39:70,914 --> 00:39:13,540
will likely be the new nominee
for Secretary of State

749
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:16,419
after Michael Kern's withdrawal
earlier this week.

750
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,712
The White House has remained
silent on whether the president

751
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:20,339
will tap Durant for a nomination,

752
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,007
but a national Zogby Poll

753
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:24,593
shows wide support for Durant
across party lines.

754
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:27,305
Catherine Durant has served ten years on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

755
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:30,057
made numerous diplomatic
missions to South America...

756
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:32,977
We can place our faith in her,
knowing that we have a responsible,

757
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:36,021
experienced, brilliant woman
representing our interests abroad.

758
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:39,483
Middle of the road, team
player, strong in defense.

759
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:42,069
If there's a woman that can work with
the joint chiefs, she's the one.

760
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,322
Durant is the way to go.
It's a no-brainer.

761
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,907
The president should stop this
pageant and simply make the call.

762
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:49,660
Why are we still talking about, if
they're going to nominate Durant?

763
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,287
Why don't they just do it already

764
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,456
so we can all stop talking about ifs

765
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,333
and start talking about when and what

766
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:59,211
and how Durant's going to
shape up foreign policy...

767
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:27,614
So, history?

768
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,035
History.

769
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:37,833
I'm very impressed, Frank.

770
00:40:37,834 --> 00:40:39,584
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mock-up.

771
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:41,379
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

772
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,464
Not yet. I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

773
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:45,508
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the president.

774
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,593
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

775
00:40:48,594 --> 00:40:51,847
- Thank you, Frank.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

776
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:55,226
- I so apologize for everything--
- No, no, no, n--

777
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:57,728
it's not necessary.

778
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,813
Now for the real meeting.

779
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:63,192
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

780
00:41:63,193 --> 00:41:65,277
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

781
00:41:65,278 --> 00:41:67,612
You know who you're gonna tap next?

782
00:41:67,613 --> 00:41:69,948
Frank, we still need you
in the house--

783
00:41:69,949 --> 00:41:12,034
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

784
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:14,537
We've got our education bill.
I was just curious.

785
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,455
Somehow the rumor is flying around

786
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,290
that we're gonna nominate
Catherine Durant.

787
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:21,043
- I'm sure you've noticed.
- Is the rumor true?

788
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,753
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

789
00:41:22,754 --> 00:41:24,463
but the president asked me
to have her vetted

790
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:26,882
in case we wanna go that route.

791
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,676
- Interesting.
- What do you think?

792
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:34,890
Well, she wouldn't be
my first choice--

793
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,517
Who would be your first choice?

794
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,810
She campaigned hard against us
in the primaries.

795
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:42,481
- That's my reservation.
- But you'd show yourself above party politics,

796
00:41:42,482 --> 00:41:44,691
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

797
00:41:44,692 --> 00:41:47,319
Decent experience,
respect across the aisle.

798
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,447
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

799
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,034
It's not the worst idea in the world.

800
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:16,681
- Where are you getting this shit?
- What?

801
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:20,144
- Your stories. Who are you fucking?
- I was just--

802
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:23,063
- Nobody.
- Oh, come on.

803
00:42:23,064 --> 00:42:26,317
You're a metro scrub,
and now look at you.

804
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:28,235
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

805
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:31,196
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

806
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:33,115
Excuse me.

807
00:42:38,662 --> 00:42:41,123
All set.

808
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,628
- Is this your first remote?
- Yeah, it's my first time.

809
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:58,516
Right into the camera,
don't shift in your seat,

810
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:61,143
and there's no reason to speak
above a conversational volume.

811
00:43:61,144 --> 00:43:63,395
- The mic will pick you up. You all ready?
- Yeah.

812
00:43:63,396 --> 00:43:65,648
All right.
Don't forget to breathe.

813
00:43:69,234 --> 00:43:11,778
Five, four...

814
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:19,870
We'd like to welcome Zoe
Barnes from the Washington Herald.

815
00:43:19,871 --> 00:43:21,997
Zoe, thank you for joining us.

816
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,708
I'm very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

817
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:28,212
You broke the education bill, the
Kern editorial, and now Durant.

818
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:30,839
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

819
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,757
And it's truly been a team effort.

820
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,759
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.

821
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,847
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

822
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:41,141
First national story, first...

823
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,069
Thank you.

824
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:55,822
Calling it a night.

825
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:59,577
See you tomorrow, sir.

826
00:44:65,290 --> 00:44:68,043
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

827
00:44:68,044 --> 00:44:70,671
First national story,

828
00:44:70,672 --> 00:44:12,839
first front-page byline,

829
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,467
first TV interview.

830
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:20,305
I would wave to my mom, but the
cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

831
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:26,311
What a roller coaster.

832
00:44:26,312 --> 00:44:30,232
It really is too bad.
Kern was a good man.

833
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,526
- And now Catherine Durant.
- Yes.

834
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:34,903
Right place, right time, I suppose.

835
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,822
- We like her, don't we?
- Very much.

836
00:44:37,823 --> 00:44:40,992
Question is, does she like San
Corp as much as we like her?

837
00:44:40,993 --> 00:44:43,579
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

838
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,539
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

839
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,208
- No. You always like a sure thing.
- When it avails itself.

840
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:50,252
- Good night, Remy.
- Good night, Frank.

841
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:53,714
- See you around.
- Hopefully less and less now.

842
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:61,263
Oh, no.
I charged the wrong thing.

843
00:45:61,264 --> 00:45:64,099
- What did you have again?
- A medium decaf latte.

844
00:45:64,100 --> 00:45:67,645
Med lat, dec.

845
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:14,401
I don't know how to get it to go back.

846
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:17,028
- This one and this one.
- This one?

847
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:19,197
No. Let me do it.

848
00:45:32,337 --> 00:45:34,463
I have to ask you
to stay back, congressman.

849
00:45:34,464 --> 00:45:37,090
- What's going on?
- Some guy was trying to get into the building.

850
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:40,302
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

851
00:46:62,658 --> 00:46:66,119
Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

852
00:46:66,120 --> 00:46:68,205
Nothing will come of this.

853
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:15,086
Why don't you let these nice
gentlemen take you home?

854
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:25,263
Cover him up.
It's cold out here.

855
00:46:25,264 --> 00:46:27,474
You heard the congressman.

856
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,560
Cover him up.

857
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:53,584
Francis?

858
00:47:42,718 --> 00:47:53,329
